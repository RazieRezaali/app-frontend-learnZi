# app-frontend-learnzi

LearnZi Frontend is the client-side application for the LearnZi platform â€” a web app designed to help users learn Chinese characters more effectively through categorization, scanning (OCR), quizzes, and personalized study cards.

This frontend is built with Vue 3, styled using Bootstrap 5, and communicates with a Laravel backend and Python microservices for OCR and text-to-speech functionality.
